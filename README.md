# m2a.py
Metin2 Python Archiver

This is an old 2013 project, but it works perfectly fine. It can be run on Windows, FreeBSD and everywhere else.
Anything is written in python, and just the xtea/lzo algorithms are extended as PYD (cpython).
The execution (compress/decompress) is very fast.

This tool is for:
- eter packs (eix&epk MCOZ&EPKD structs)
- item_proto (152&156 structs + new ones)
- mob_proto (pre&post 2011=235&255 structs + new ones)
- locale_%s.addr (2011&2013 structs)
